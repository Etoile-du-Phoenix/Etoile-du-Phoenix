- 👋 Hi, I’m @Etoile-du-Phoenix
- 👀 I am interested in web development, JavaScript code language, Python and CSS language.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to backup discord messages, I know it's not much, but I'm in 5th grade and I haven't had any coding classes so I'm already doing well.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on discord bot projects on the automation of backups and also for the few clan war rp servers to automate character sheets (oc). Moderation also for everything related to cyber security, anti-raid, self-banning.
- 📫 You can contact me by my email address which is: etoiledusoleillevant@gmail.com.
- 😄 Nickname: Phoenix or Star 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a semi-pro skier who took part in a ski competition. I won it with the exact time which had to be a ten-thousandth of a second longer and I was second, I did 37.0055 seconds for 1.5 km except that while going back down to the end of the black slope to take the ski lift again a guy mowed me down while I was at 120 km/h and I sprained both wrists. But I also play rugby, we played in Switzerland and we won. WE ARE CHAMPION OF OUR DIVISION.
